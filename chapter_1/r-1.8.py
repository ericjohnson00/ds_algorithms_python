""" Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence,
such as a string. If string s has length n, and expression s[k] is used for  
-n ≤ k < 0, what is the equivalent index j ≥ 0 such that s[j] references
the same element?"""

#Solution

# Let's say n is the length of the string s. 
# Then, the index j can be calculated as follows:
# j = n + k

    """
    
    Visual Representation:
For the string s = "Python":

Index (positive)	0	1	2	3	4	5
Character	        P	y	t	h	o	n
Index (negative)	-6	-5	-4	-3	-2	-1
s[0] is 'P', and s[-6] is also 'P'.

s[1] is 'y', and s[-5] is also 'y'.

And so on.
